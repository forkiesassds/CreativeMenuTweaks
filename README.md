Tweaked Creative Menu is a mod that tweaks the Creative Menu. This mod is a fork of [CreativeMenuTweaks](https://modrinth.com/mod/creative-menu-tweaks).

## Features
- Tabs now emit a sound when clicked
- Tabs now pop out when hovering.
- Tab icons now pop out when the tab is selected, rather than staying in place.
- Tooltips are placed above the tabs, rather than following the cursor.
- Above features can be disabled through the config.
- Custom tabs can be made through datapacks, in addition existing tab contents can be expanded or replaced. This is handy if you are making a modpack and need to adjust the Creative Menu.
- Support for both Fabric and NeoForge

## Configuration
The mod can be configured by either editing the configuration file manually, or through the GUI if [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl) is installed. See the [wiki](https://github.com/forkiesassds/TweakedCreativeMenu/wiki/Configuration) on how to manually modify the configuration.

## Data-driven tabs
Custom tabs can be added through datapacks and can contain individual items with optional components, item tags or loot tables. In addition new entries can be added to existing tabs, or have their contents be replaced. See the [wiki](https://github.com/forkiesassds/TweakedCreativeMenu/wiki/Data%E2%80%90driven-tabs) on how to modify tabs and to make custom tabs.
